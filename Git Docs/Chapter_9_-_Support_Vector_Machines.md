Chapter 9 Lab: Support Vector Machines
================

This lab primarily focuses on creating creating and tweaking a variety of Support Vector Classifiers using the `e1071` library. The text mentions the availability of the `LiblineaR` library for very large linear problems, but we do not use it in this lab. We conclude the lab with a discussion/implementation of ROC curves using the `ROCR` library. The topics that will be covered in this lab include:

-   Support Vector Classifiers

-   Support Vector Machines (SVM)

-   ROC Curves

-   SVMs with K &gt; 2 Classes
