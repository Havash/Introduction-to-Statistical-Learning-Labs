# Introduction to Statisical Learning Lab Walkthroughs
#### Script Author : Will Morgan
#### Textbook Authors: Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani


### Purpose
This repository is meant to keep track of my personal lab work done in the textbook: *An Introduction to Statistical Learning 
with Applications in R*, written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 


### Repository Guidelines and Basic Info
The repository is organized into basically two folders - _Git Docs_ and _Code_. If you plan on following on 
to these walkthroughs in your browser, I would recommend using the Lab write-ups located in the _Git
Docs_ folder. They are specifically formatted to make it easy for you to quickly read and browse each method
that is covered. If you plan on spending more time using this code in your R Studio instance, go ahead and download
copies of the Labs located in the _Code_ folder. The majority of them are R files, meaning you can simply load them as scripts.
As of Dec 2017, I have begun transitioning to writing this scripts in Rmd files so they can be adapted to the Git browser.
